Feature:
  Background: Setup
    Given DCAS collection config "dcas-mychannel" is defined for collection "dcas" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and timeToLive=60m
    Given DCAS collection config "docs-mychannel" is defined for collection "docs" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and timeToLive=60m
    Given off-ledger collection config "meta_data_coll" is defined for collection "meta_data" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=1, and timeToLive=60m

    Given the channel "mychannel" is created and all peers have joined

    And "system" chaincode "sidetreetxn_cc" is instantiated from path "in-process" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy "dcas-mychannel"
    And "system" chaincode "document_cc" is instantiated from path "in-process" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy "docs-mychannel,meta_data_coll"

  @create_did_doc
  Scenario: create valid did doc
    When client sends request to create DID document "fixtures/testdata/didDocument.json" as "queryParameter"
    Then check success response contains "#didDocumentHash"

    When client sends request to create DID document "fixtures/testdata/didDocument.json" as "JSON"
    Then check success response contains "#didDocumentHash"

    When client sends request to resolve DID document
    Then check success response contains "#didDocumentHash"

  @did-sidetree-batch-writer-recovery
  Scenario: Batch writer recovers from peers down
    Given container "peer0.org2.example.com" is paused
    And container "peer1.org2.example.com" is paused
    And we wait 2 seconds

    When client sends request to create DID document "fixtures/testdata/didDocument2.json" as "JSON"
    Then check success response contains "#didDocumentHash"

    Then we wait 10 seconds

    Given container "peer0.org2.example.com" is unpaused
    And container "peer1.org2.example.com" is unpaused

    # Wait for batch writer to cut batch
    And we wait 10 seconds

    When client sends request to resolve DID document
    Then check success response contains "#didDocumentHash"
